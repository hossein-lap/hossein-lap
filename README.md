# Hos

Lua and Bash programmer with a passion about open-source and trees. Trying to
be up to date, thus I'm always learning and will continue to do so. Love the
concept of Libre software and hardware. Suckless guy who likes to read and
write - and execute ;)

I've become to like the philosophy of DevOps. The path I had chosen was towards
DevOps without realizing it. After becoming aware of this matter, I've decided
to enter this field in the right way.
